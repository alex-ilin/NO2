 NppExec has advanced "hidden" settings which can be set manually.
 You need to edit NppExec's ini-file: "\Plugins\Config\NppExec.ini".

  --------------------------------------------------------------

 The purpose of each key is described below.
 You can add specified keys to [Console] or [Options] section of 
 this ini-file.
 For example, you can modify it in the following way:
 
   [Options]
   HotKey=F6
   ToolbarBtn=1
   WatchScriptFile=1
   
   [Console]
   Visible=0
   OEM=1
   CmdHistory=1
   ChildProcess_StartupTimeout_ms=240
   ChildProcess_CycleTimeout_ms=120
   Path_AutoDblQuotes=0
   CmdHistory_MaxItems=256
   Exec_MaxCount=100
   RichEdit_MaxTextLength=4194304
   CommentDelimiter=//
   NoEmptyVars=1
   SaveCmdHistory=1

 
 ChildProcess_StartupTimeout_ms
 ------------------------------
   This parameter is important when a child console process is created.
   The child process usually can't be created immediately, therefore
   we must give some time to this process to be started.
   Here is a general implementation of this part of code:
   
       if ( CreateProcess( ... , &ProcInfo ) )
       {
           CloseHandle( ProcInfo.hThread );
           WaitForSingleObject( ProcInfo.hProcess, STARTUP_TIMEOUT );
           ...
       }
 
   When the process is started, WaitForSingleObject returns.
   But, if the value of STARTUP_TIMEOUT is too low, WaitForSingleObject 
   may return before the process is started.
   If default value of ChildProcess_StartupTimeout_ms is not enough for
   your PC, you can increase it. IMHO, it can not exceed 400 ms.
   
 
 ChildProcess_CycleTimeout_ms
 ----------------------------
   The only purpose of this parameter is to decrease the CPU usage.
   The bigger value you set, the less CPU usage you get :-)
   Here is an implementation of this part of code in outline:
   
       do {
           // reading from the process'es pipe
           ...
       } while ( WaitForSingleObject( ProcInfo.hProcess, 
                     CYCLE_TIMEOUT ) == WAIT_TIMEOUT );
   
   Don't forget that actually the value of ChildProcess_CycleTimeout_ms
   is a pause between requests to the child console process'es output, 
   so values > 500 ms are not recommened.

 
 Path_AutoDblQuotes
 ------------------
   If you enable this option (set it to 1), then path to executable 
   which contains spaces (for example, "my program 1.exe") will be 
   automatically enclosed in quotes "".
   It is disabled by default because of a bug with executables w/o
   extension. For example, this line
   
     cmd /c calc.exe
   
   will be modified (if this option is enabled) to this one:
   
     "cmd /c calc.exe"
     
   because "cmd" is given without extension ".exe".
   Therefore don't forget to enclose paths with spaces in quotes
   manually, when this option is disabled.
   
 
 CmdHistory_MaxItems
 -------------------
   Specifies maximum number of items in the console commands history.
   
 
 Exec_MaxCount
 -------------
   Specifies maximum number of NPP_EXEC calls within one script.
   This value is needed to prevent the infinite loop of several scripts
   which call each other, e.g.
   
     ::script1
     npp_exec script2
     
     ::script2
     npp_exec script1
   
 
 RichEdit_MaxTextLength  
 ----------------------
   Specifies maximum number of characters which can be stored or 
   pasted into the Console dialog's rich edit control.


 CommentDelimiter
 ----------------
   Specifies a comment delimiter  :-)  I.e. all characters after
   this delimiter are understood as a comment, and the text line
   (command) is truncated at the position of this delimiter.
   Exception: 
   - when the comment delimiter is // then :// is not truncated 
   at the position of // (because :// can be a part of http://).
   Note:
   - if you specify empty comment delimiter i.e.

     CommentDelimiter=

   then you can not use comments in your commands/scripts because
   there is no comment delimiter in this case.

 
 Visible
 -------
   If you enable this option (set it to 1), then the Console window
   will be visible when Notepad++ starts. Otherwise, when this option
   is set to 0 (default value), there will be no Console window opened
   when Notepad++ starts.
 
 
 NoEmptyVars
 -----------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), then all unset variables
   such as "$(var)" will be replaced with "" (empty string).
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), then unset variable "$(var)" 
   will not be replaced with empty string i.e. it will remain "$(var)".
 
 
 SaveCmdHistory
 --------------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1) and "Console Commands History"
   is checked, then the console commands history is saved to file
   "npec_cmdhistory.txt" when Notepad++ exits. And the commands history
   is restored from this file when Notepad++ starts.
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), then the console commands
   history is not saved and restored.
 
 
 HotKey
 ------
   Specifies the plugin hotkey which calls the "Execute..." dialog.
   Available values are: F1, F2, F3 ... F12.
 
 
 ToolbarBtn
 ----------
   ToolbarBtn = 0  -  no toolbar button;
   ToolbarBtn = 1  -  the toolbar button shows the Console window;
   ToolbarBtn = 2  -  the toolbar button calls the "Execute..." dialog.
   ToolbarBtn = 3  -  the toolbar button directly executes last script.
   
   
 WatchScriptFile
 ---------------
   When this option is enabled (set to 1), the plugin rereads the file
   with saved scripts if its time stamp has been changed. The plugin
   checks the file time stamp when you call the "Execute..." dialog.
   If this option is disabled (set to 0), the plugin does not check
   the file time stamp and does not reread this file.
